RSA and iconic memory paradigm - reading in color 

Link to project proposal form: https://project-proposal.dccn.nl/Form/31#Funding

TO DO: 
<br> 13-06-2019 after pilot #2
<br>
Consistency:
- DONE Check button formatting on Windows machine (looks very different on a Mac, but working)

Iconic Memory: 
- TRY DIRECTLY IN LAB - First trial of each block starts too fast
- DONE Output bids format (Olympia)
- DONE Slow down trials (ITIs)
- DONE Check visual angle Nicolas' paper, cubicle 1
- DONE Chin rest (in closet next to cubile)

MRI:
- DONE Check psychopy and internet connection on normal experiment mode, PsychoPy only in TEST mode, internet does not always work, make sure to have everything (instructions) on a USB stick.
- DONE Check timing of stimuli on dummy scanner
- DONE How to transfer participant colors from behavior to MRI? upload Google drive folder /colors/
- DONE Instructions covered by mirror in scanner, need to make the more centered.
- DONE Change name of output files to match bids format: sub-01_sess-01_task-rsa_run-01.tsv
- DONE RSA task - make sure all responses are being logged, so also false alarms, this is important for the nuisance regressor.
